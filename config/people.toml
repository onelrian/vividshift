# VividShift People Configuration
# =================================
# This file defines all residents and their group assignments for the VividShift
# work group distribution system.
#
# Schema:
# - [groups.<name>]: Group definitions with metadata
#   - description: Human-readable description
#   - constraints: List of constraint identifiers
#
# - [[person]]: Individual resident records
#   - name: Full name (must be unique)
#   - group: Reference to a defined group (must exist)
#   - active: Whether the person is currently participating (true/false)
#
# Adding/Removing People:
# - To add: Copy a [[person]] block and update name/group/active
# - To deactivate: Set active = false (keeps history)
# - To add a new group: Add [groups.<name>] section and update constraint logic
#
# Validation Rules:
# - Names must be unique across all people
# - Groups must be defined before being referenced
# - At least one active person required per group
